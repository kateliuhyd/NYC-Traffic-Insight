# TODO: Import requests for HTTP calls to Open-Meteo API
# TODO: Load your point-based traffic GeoJSON file containing coordinates and timestamps
# TODO: For each feature in that file:
#     - Extract longitude, latitude from 'geometry'['coordinates']
#     - Extract timestamp from 'properties'['Timestamp']
#     - Format timestamp into the required ISO format for Open-Meteo API
#     - Construct Open-Meteo Historical Weather API URL with parameters:
#         * latitude
#         * longitude
#         * start_date and end_date (same day as timestamp)
#         * hourly variables (e.g., temperature_2m, precipitation, etc.)
#     - Make the API request
#     - Parse the returned weather data (temperature, precipitation, etc.)
#     - Attach weather data to the feature's 'properties' under a 'Weather' key

# TODO: Save the enriched GeoJSON with weather overlays for debugging/inspection if needed

# TODO: Modify the FastAPI `/map` endpoint:
#     - Overlay traffic lines as before (already implemented)
#     - Overlay points with weather data:
#         * Use folium.CircleMarker or folium.Marker at each point
#         * Use color, radius, or popup text to represent temperature or precipitation on that timestamp
#         * Example: popup showing "Temp: XXÂ°C, Rain: YYmm, Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"

# TODO: Ensure all overlays are added to the same folium.Map instance so weather overlays sit atop traffic lines

# TODO: Save the final map as HTML and return using FileResponse as before
